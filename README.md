# Akan Name 

# Description
In many parts of Ghana, and elsewhere in West Africa, a personâ€™s name is determined by the day of the week on which she/he was born.
This name generator takes a user's birthday(year, month and date) and gender information, determines the day of the week on which they were born and derives an Akan name depending on their gender.
